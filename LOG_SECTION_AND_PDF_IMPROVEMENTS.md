# Log Section Hidden & Beautiful PDF Design Created

## Overview
Successfully hidden the log section from the results page and completely redesigned the PDF report with a beautiful, professional design that's no longer an "abomination."

## Changes Made

### 1. **Hidden Log Section** ✅
**Issue**: Log section was visible to users but only needed for calculation debugging
**Solution**: Hidden the DetailedBreakdown component from the results page

```jsx
// Before - Visible to users
{!isPublic && (
  <DetailedBreakdown
    userData={calculatedResults}
    onNavigateToCalculator={handleNavigateToCalculator}
  />
)}

// After - Hidden for users, available for debugging
{false && !isPublic && (
  <DetailedBreakdown
    userData={calculatedResults}
    onNavigateToCalculator={handleNavigateToCalculator}
  />
)}
```

**Result**: Clean results page without debugging information cluttering the user experience.
