  - [x] Implemented AuthProvider with session persistence
  - [x] Set up authentication hooks (useAuth)

### Database Schema
- [x] **profile_session Table:**
  - [x] Created table with one-to-one relationship to auth.users
  - [x] Added RLS policies for security
  - [x] Implemented automatic updated_at trigger
  - [x] Set up user_id as unique constraint

### Login System
- [x] **Login Page (/login):**
  - [x] Created responsive login form with validation
  - [x] Implemented email/password authentication
  - [x] Added error handling with toast notifications
  - [x] Included "forgot password" placeholder

### Dual-Access System
- [x] **Access Selection Modal:**

  - [x] Implemented "Continue with Public Version" option
  - [x] Added feature comparison between versions
  - [x] Integrated after first calculator step (Years of Service)

### Public Version Features
- [x] **Public Access Banner:**
  - [x] Created persistent sticky banner for public users
  - [x] Added multiple banner variants (default, minimal, prominent, sticky)
  - [x] Implemented global wrapper component
  - [x] Shows across all calculator pages when in public mode

- [x] **Limited Results Display:**
  - [x] Modified GapAnalysisCard to hide exact dollar amounts
  - [x] Shows "Gap Identified" instead of specific values
  - [x] Added "Sign in to see exact amount" message
  - [x] Maintained risk level indicators

### User Flow Implementation
- [x] **Session Management:**
  - [x] Implemented form data persistence when redirecting to login
  - [x] Restored calculator state after successful authentication
  - [x] Added flags to prevent duplicate modal displays
  - [x] Created smooth transition between public and authenticated modes

- [x] **Route Protection:**
  - [x] Utilized existing ProtectedRoute component
  - [x] Maintained RoleGuard for premium features
  - [x] Ensured gap calculator requires authentication + premium role

### Error Handling & UX
- [x] **Authentication Errors:**
  - [x] Handle invalid credentials gracefully
  - [x] Show specific error messages for different scenarios
  - [x] Provide feedback for unconfirmed email accounts
  - [x] Display loading states during authentication

- [x] **Navigation & Redirects:**
  - [x] Proper redirect after login to intended destination
  - [x] Maintain profession and form data through auth flow
  - [x] Handle logout with appropriate cleanup
  - [x] Update navigation state in real-time

## Implementation Details

### Key Components
1. **AccessSelectionModal** (`src/components/auth/AccessSelectionModal.jsx`)
   - Modal for choosing between public and full access
   - Feature comparison display
   - Smooth animations with Framer Motion

2. **PublicAccessBanner** (`src/components/ui/PublicAccessBanner.jsx`)
   - Persistent banner for public users
   - Multiple display variants
   - Login CTA button

3. **PublicAccessWrapper** (`src/components/auth/PublicAccessWrapper.jsx`)
   - Global wrapper showing sticky banner
   - Adds padding to content when banner is shown

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE profile_session (
  id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role text DEFAULT 'user',
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()),
  UNIQUE(user_id)
);
```

### Security Considerations
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own profile_session
- Authentication state is verified on each request
- Session tokens are securely managed by Supabase
- Public access doesn't store sensitive data

## Environment Configuration
Required environment variables:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Test Credentials
For testing the full authentication flow:
- Email: admin@publicserv.com
- Password: admin@96

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement password reset functionality
- [ ] Add social login options (Google, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Create user registration flow
- [ ] Add email verification process
- [ ] Implement remember me functionality
- [ ] Add session timeout warnings
- [ ] Create user profile management page
- [ ] Add analytics for public vs authenticated usage
