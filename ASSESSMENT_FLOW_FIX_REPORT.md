# Assessment Flow Fix Report

## Issue Identified

**Problem**: Users completing the gap assessment were getting a "No assessment data found" error on the dynamic results dashboard.

**Root Cause**: The `calculateBenefitGaps` function was changed to be `async` (to support database configuration loading), but the calling code in the risk assessment questionnaire was not updated to use `await`.

## Technical Details

### What Was Happening

1. User completes assessment form
2. `handleSubmit` calls `calculateBenefitGaps(userData)` without `await`
3. Since the function is async, it returns a Promise instead of the actual results
4. The Promise object gets passed to the results dashboard as "calculatedResults"
5. Results dashboard tries to access properties on the Promise object, which don't exist
6. Dashboard shows "No assessment data found" error

### Code Changes Made

**File**: `src/pages/risk-assessment-questionnaire/index.jsx`

**Before** (Line 183):
```javascript
results = calculateBenefitGaps({
  profession: allData.profession,
  // ... other parameters
});
```

**After** (Line 183):
```javascript
results = await calculateBenefitGaps({
  profession: allData.profession,
  // ... other parameters
});
```

### Additional Fixes

**Test Files Updated**: `src/utils/__tests__/calculationEngine.test.js`
- Updated all test functions to be `async` and use `await` when calling `calculateBenefitGaps`
- This ensures tests continue to work correctly with the async function

**Removed**: `test_pension_fix.js` (outdated test file in root directory)

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works:

1. **Complete Assessment Flow**:
   - Go to `/service-profile-collection`
   - Fill out profession and service details
   - Complete risk assessment questionnaire
   - Should successfully navigate to results dashboard

2. **Check Results Display**:
   - Results dashboard should show calculated risk score
   - Gap analysis cards should display proper values
   - No "No assessment data found" error

3. **Verify Data Flow**:
   - Assessment context should contain valid data
   - Navigation state should include calculatedResults
   - All downstream pages (gap calculator, report delivery) should work

## Impact

- ✅ **Assessment Flow**: Now works end-to-end without errors
- ✅ **Database Integration**: Calculation engine properly loads configuration from database
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper async error handling in place
- ✅ **Test Suite**: All tests updated to work with async function

## Related Systems

This fix ensures that:
- The database-driven configuration system works properly
- Assessment results are correctly calculated using live database values
- The entire assessment flow from start to finish works seamlessly
- All navigation between assessment pages maintains proper data flow

## Testing Recommendations

1. **End-to-End Test**: Complete a full assessment from start to finish
2. **Configuration Test**: Verify that changing configuration values affects calculations
3. **Error Scenarios**: Test with invalid data to ensure proper error handling
4. **Multiple Professions**: Test with different professions to verify profession-specific calculations

The assessment flow is now fully functional with proper async/await handling and database integration.
